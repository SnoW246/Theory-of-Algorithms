; Q8. Write a function chse in Racket that takes three lists
;     x, y and z of equal length and containing only 0â€™s and 1â€™s.
;     It should return a list containing the elements of y in
;     the positions where x is 1 and the elements of z otherwise.
;     For example:
;     > (chse (list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1) (list 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) (list 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1))
;     '(0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1)

(define (chse x y z))

(chse (list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1) (list 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) (list 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1))
;Expected output: '(0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1)

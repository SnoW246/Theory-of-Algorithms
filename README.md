# Theory of Algorithms - Functional Programming
**Fourth Year Undergraduate Module at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) Ireland**

**Lecturer:** Dr. Ian McLoughlin

**Student name:** Adrian Golias

**Student ID:** G00318626

## Purpose of module:
Theory of algorithms provide introduction to the areas of computation and computabilityand learn practical skills in the development of software using a selection of programming paradigms.

## Learning outcomes
* Compare different models of computation.
* Write computer programs using a selection of programming paradigms.
* Analyse the complexity of an algorithm.
* Identify difficult computational problems in everyday programming.

## What is Racket?
**Racket** is a multi-paradigm programming language. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. This language is used in scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

The platform provides an implementation of the **Racket language** with run-time system, various libraries, JIT compiler along with a development environment called **DrRacket** written in Racket itself.

The platform is free and open-source software, which is a plus.

## Problems/ CA:

For the CA problems I was allowed to use only the following functions:

**cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, map, =** 

And the basic numerical operators:

__(+, -, *, /, modulo)__
